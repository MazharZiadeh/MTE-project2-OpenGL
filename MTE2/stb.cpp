// plz do not ever compile this file. it is already compiled and included in the project. this is just for reference.
//

// 
// The above code snippet includes the necessary header file "stb_image.h" and defines the macro "STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION".
// The macro "STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION" is used to enable the implementation of the stb_image library.

// The stb_image library is a single-file public domain (or MIT licensed) C/C++ library for loading images in various formats.
// It provides a simple interface to load images into memory as a raw pixel array.

// Including the "stb_image.h" header file allows us to use the functions and macros provided by the stb_image library.

// The "#define" directive is used to define a macro. In this case, we define the macro "STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION".
// This macro is typically used to enable the implementation of the stb_image library in a single source file.

// The "#include" directive is used to include the "stb_image.h" header file.
// The angle brackets "<>" indicate that the header file is located in a system directory.

// By including the "stb_image.h" header file, we gain access to the functions and macros provided by the stb_image library.
// These functions and macros can be used to load and manipulate images in our C++ program.
